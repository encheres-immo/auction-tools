### Getting Started

We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager, since it's not only faster and safer than npm and yarn, but also because it has better support for monorepos. Global commands are :

| Command          | Action                |
| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
| `pnpm install`   | Installs dependencies |
| `pnpm changeset` | Generate a changelog  |

For package-specific commands and instructions, please refer to the README of the package, listed above.
