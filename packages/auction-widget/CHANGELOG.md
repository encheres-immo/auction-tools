## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 3df41c8: Added event emission functionality to the auction widget. The widget now dispatches events prefixed with `auction-widget:`, which can be handled using JavaScript on your website. The available events are:

  | Name         | Payload                                            | Description                                                                                          |
  | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `bid_placed` | `{ amount: number, date: string }`                 | Emitted when a bid is successfully placed. Can be used to play a sound, display a notification, etc. |
  | `new_bid`    | `{ amount: number, bidder: string, date: string }` | Emitted when a new bid is placed. Can be used to play a sound, display a notification, etc.          |
  | `register`   | `{}`                                               | Emitted when the user registers for the auction. Can be used for analytics, display a message, etc.  |

  To listen to an event, add an event listener to the widget element in your website's JavaScript:

  ```js
  document
    .getElementById("auction-widget")
    .addEventListener("auction-widget:new_bid", (event) => {
      console.log("New bid:", event.detail);
    });
  ```

  This event list is meant to be extended in the future, so feel free to ask for new events if you need them!

- 3df41c8: Fixed an error where the form would accept non-number values. Also added a new CSS variable to customize errors color.

  | Variable name                  | Default value |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------- |
  | `--auction-widget-error-color` | `#dc2626`     |

- 3df41c8: Renamed the `source` attribute to `source-name`, to avoid conflicts with existing HTML attribute. This is technically a **breaking change**, but it should not affect any existing usage of the widget.

  ```html
  <!-- Before -->
  <div id="auction-widget" source="APIMO" [... other attributes]></div>
  <!-- After -->
  <div id="auction-widget" source-name="APIMO" [... other attributes]></div>
  ```

- 3df41c8: Added CSS reset to isolate widget styles from host page and ensure consistency across browsers. This change **may cause minor visual changes** as fewer styles are inherited from the host page.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 65b24d5: Add an optional attribute to allow users to register for the auctionâ€”This registration must be accepted by the agent later, or the user will not be able to place bids. If set to false, agent's contact information will be displayed instead.

  ```html
  <div
    id="auction-widget"
    [...
    other
    attributes]
    allow-user-registration="false"
  ></div>
  ```

  Default value is `true`.
