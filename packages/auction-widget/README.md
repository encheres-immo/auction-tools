# Ench√®res Immo's auction widget

Add a real-estate auction widget to your website, powered by Ench√®res Immo's API üöÄ 

## Prerequisites

To use this widget, you need an API key from Ench√®res Immo. If you are a real estate professional and not yet a partner of Ench√®res Immo, please [book a demo](https://1awi3zs5bi0.typeform.com/to/N63LlgvM) to get started. If you are already a partner, contact us to get your API key.

## Installation

This widget is available as a package on npm. To install it, run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @encheresimmo/auction-widget
# Using pnpm
pnpm install @encheresimmo/auction-widget
# Using yarn (not recommended)
yarn add @encheresimmo/auction-widget
```

This widget is also available as a standalone script. To use it, add the following script and style tags to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@encheres-immo/auction-widget@0/dist/auction-widget.js" defer></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@encheres-immo/auction-widget@0/dist/auction-widget.css">
```

## Upgrade

To upgrade this widget to the latest version using npm, run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm update @encheresimmo/auction-widget
# Using pnpm
pnpm update @encheresimmo/auction-widget
# Using yarn (not recommended)
yarn upgrade @encheresimmo/auction-widget
```

To upgrade the standalone script to the latest version, update the version number after `@` in the script and style tags in your HTML file. You should only write one number, e.g. `@0`, to get automatically the latest version of the major version you are using (see below).

We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), version numbers can therefore be interpreted as follows:

| Number change | Meaning                                                                     | Safe to upgrade? |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `x.x.0`       | Bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches...                | Yes              |
| `x.0.x`       | New features, or backward-compatible changes...                             | Yes              |
| `0.x.x`       | Big breaking changes, you should consult the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)... | No               |

## Usage

To use the widget, add the following HTML tag to your website, and replace `YOUR API KEY` with your Ench√®res Immo API key and `PROPERTY ID` with the Ench√®res Immo's ID of the property you want to display.

```html
<div id="auction-widget" api-key="YOUR API KEY" property-id="PROPERTY ID"></div>
```

Alternatively, you can retrieve your property from a CRM by replacing `property-id` by `source` (e.g. `source="APIMO"`), `source-id` (the ID of the property in the CRM), and `source-agency-id` (the ID of the agency in the CRM).

```html
<div id="auction-widget" api-key="YOUR API KEY" source="APIMO" source-id="APIMO PROPERTY ID" source-agency-id="APIMO AGENCY ID"></div>
```

## Configuration

### Features

You can enable or disable features of the widget by setting the corresponding attributes on the HTML tag. Here are the available features:

| Attribute                 | Default                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allow-user-registration` | `true`                          | Display a button to allow users to register for the auction‚ÄîThis registration must be accepted by the agent later, or the user will not be able to place bids. If set to `false`, agent's contact information will be displayed instead. |
| `tos-url`                 | `https://encheres-immo.com/cgu` | URL to your custom terms of service page for auctions, must be a valid URL and confirmed by Ench√®res Immo.                                                                                                                               |

### Styling

You can customize the widget by setting CSS variables in your website's stylesheet. Here are the available variables:

| Variable name                      | Default value |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `--auction-widget-highlight-color` | `#ef673d`     |
| `--auction-widget-dark-color`      | `#002d40`     |
| `--auction-widget-error-color`     | `#dc2626`     |
| `--auction-widget-border-radius`   | `0.5rem`      |
| `--auction-widget-btn-radius`      | `0.5rem`      |
| `--auction-widget-base-font`       | `sans-serif`  |
| `--auction-widget-title-font`      | `sans-serif`  |
| `--auction-widget-countdown-font`  | `monospace`   |

For example, to change the highlight color to blue, add the following CSS to your website's stylesheet:

```css
:root {
  --auction-widget-highlight-color: blue;
}
```

To override the default styles, you can also use the layer `@auction-widget-override` :

```css
@auction-widget {
  .auction-widget-label {
    border-radius: 1rem;
  }
}
```

Finally‚Äîas required by OAuth2‚Äîauthentication pages are hosted on the Ench√®res Immo domain. You can customize the look and feel of these pages through your Ench√®res Immo "Custom Theme" settings.

### Events

The widget emits events that you can listen to in your website's JavaScript. They are all prefixed with `auction-widget:`. Here are the available events:

| Name         | Payload                                            | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bid_placed` | `{ amount: number, date: string }`                 | Emitted when a bid is successfully placed. Can be used to play a sound, display a notification, etc. |
| `new_bid`    | `{ amount: number, bidder: string, date: string }` | Emitted when a new bid is placed. Can be used to play a sound, display a notification, etc.          |
| `register`   | `{}`                                               | Emitted when the user registers for the auction. Can be used for analytics, display a message, etc.  |

To listen to an event, add an event listener to the widget element in your website's JavaScript:

```js
document.getElementById('auction-widget').addEventListener('auction-widget:new_bid', (event) => {
  console.log('New bid:', event.detail);
});
```

This event list is meant to be extended in the future, so feel free to ask for new events if you need them!
