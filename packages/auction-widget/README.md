## Customization

You can customize the widget by setting CSS variables in your website's stylesheet. Here are the available variables:

| Variable name                      | Default value |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `--auction-widget-highlight-color` | `#ef673d`     |
| `--auction-widget-dark-color`      | `#002d40`     |
| `--auction-widget-border-radius`   | `0.5rem`      |
| `--auction-widget-btn-radius`      | `0.5rem`      |
| `--auction-widget-base-font`       | `sans-serif`  |
| `--auction-widget-title-font`      | `sans-serif`  |
| `--auction-widget-countdown-font`  | `monospace`   |

For example, to change the highlight color to blue, add the following CSS to your website's stylesheet:

```css
:root {
  --auction-widget-highlight-color: blue;
}
```

To override the default styles, you can also use the layer `@auction-widget` :

```css
@auction-widget {
  .auction-widget-label {
    border-radius: 1rem;
  }
}
```

Finally‚Äîas required by OAuth2‚Äîauthentication pages are hosted on the Ench√®res Immo domain. You can customize the look and feel of these pages through your Ench√®res Immo "Custom Theme" settings.
