# EnchÃ¨res Immo's auction widget - Example

This is a simple example of how to use the auction widget. Powered by Astro ðŸš€ 

## Getting started

You'll need to set up the environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of the `example` package :

```env
API_KEY = "Your api key"
API_ENV = "local" | "staging" | "production"
PROPERTY_ID = " Your property id "
```

`API_ENV` is optional and defaults to `production`. `local` requires you to run the EnchÃ¨res Immo API locally, on port 4000.

## Useful commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
