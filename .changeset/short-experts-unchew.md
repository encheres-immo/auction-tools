Add an optional attribute to allow users to register for the auctionâ€”This registration must be accepted by the agent later, or the user will not be able to place bids. If set to false, agent's contact information will be displayed instead.

```html
<div id="auction-widget" [... other attributes] allow-user-registration="false"></div>
```

Default value is `true`.
